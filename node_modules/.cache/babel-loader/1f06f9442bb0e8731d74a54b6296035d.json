I work as a Product Manager in American Express, under the Mobile App team. In my day to day I work to ensure that Amex Card Members are gaining the best possible experience on their Mobile App. There are three reasons why I would like to enrol in the bootcamp, and why I would be a good fit: 1) Through curiosity I have dabbled in programming using various languages before, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every single instance. Though I could keep going on down the path of learning by myself, I believe a structure and community around my learning can speed up my learning. 2) Which brings me to - why do I want to learn in the first place? I would start by saying I am looking for a career switch into engineering. I work with engineering teams quite a bit and I have noticed I feel way more comfortable speaking technical rather than business. Regardless of the language, I enjoy the process of finding solutions and see them come to life due to my work. I believe every problem has them. 3) I believe the present and the future is in Tech. It is one thing to be excited to see where these trends can take us, but another to be part of the movement, and even if in a small way, I want to be part of the movement. I already have quite a bit of context into tech world through my role and believe due to this I will fit in very well into an engineering role.\")))));\n}\n\nexport default AboutMe;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["C:/Users/vegas/react-multi-page-website/src/components/AboutMe.jsx"],"names":["React","AboutMe"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;;AAEA,SAASC,OAAT,GAAmB;AACjB,SACE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,SAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACE;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,WAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACE;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,wBAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACE;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,UAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACE;AACE,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,YADR;AAEE,IAAA,GAAG,EAAC,uBAFN;AAGE,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,OAHR;AAIE,IAAA,MAAM,EAAC,OAJT;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADF,CADF,EASE;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,UAAX;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gBADF,EAEE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,y2CAFF,CATF,CADF,CADF,CADF;AA2CD;;AAED,eAAeA,OAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction AboutMe() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"AboutMe\">\r\n      <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"row align-items-center\">\r\n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n            <img\r\n              class=\"img-fluids\"\r\n              src=\"../Vaish-Business.jpg\"\r\n              width=\"450px\"\r\n              height=\"500px\"\r\n            />\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"col-lg-5\">\r\n            <h1>About Me</h1>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Hi - I am Vaish.
