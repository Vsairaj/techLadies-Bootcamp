            <p>

              Hi - I am Vaish. I work as a Product Manager in American Express,
              under the Mobile App team. In my day to day I work to ensure that
              Amex Card Members are gaining the best possible experience on
              their Mobile App.<br></br> There are three reasons why I would
              like to enrol in the bootcamp, and why I would be a good fit:{" "}
              <br></br>1) Through curiosity I have dabbled in programming using
              various languages before, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every
              single instance. Though I could keep going on down the path of
              learning by myself, I believe a structure and community around my
              learning can speed up my learning.<br></br> 2) Which brings me to
              - why do I want to learn in the first place? I would start by
              saying I am looking for a career switch into engineering. I work
              with engineering teams quite a bit and I have noticed I feel way
              more comfortable speaking technical rather than business.
              Regardless of the language, I enjoy the process of finding
              solutions and see them come to life due to my work. Seeing a task
              completed and the program come to life brings me immense joy.{" "}
              <br></br> 3) I believe the present and the future is in Tech. It
              is one thing to be excited to see where these trends can take us,
              but another to be part of the movement, and even if in a small
              way, I want to be part of the movement. I already have quite a bit
              of context into tech world through my role and believe due to this
              I will fit in very well into an engineering role.
